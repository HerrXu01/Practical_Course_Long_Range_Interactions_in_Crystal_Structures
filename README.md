# Long-Range Interactions in Crystal Structures

![Poster](poster.png)

This repository contains the code and resources used in the practical course "Long-Range Interactions in Crystal Structures", conducted by the Data Analytics and Machine Learning Group at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Our work investigates the capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to capture long-range interatomic interactions within crystal structures, with a focus on exploring if the three physics-inspired biases on the target (energies) will help lower the prediction error.

## Motivation

The discovery of new materials, drugs, and the process of protein folding are crucial areas of research. Traditional quantum-chemical calculations, while accurate, are computationally expensive. Machine learning offers a more efficient alternative, but capturing the complex long-range interactions between atoms remains a challenge.

## Approach

We employ physics-inspired biases, including explicit computations for:
- Long-range electrostatic interactions
- Long-range dispersion interactions
- Nuclear repulsion

Our methodology utilizes Ewald-based Message Passing, which divides the task into short- and long-range components and employs parametrized filters for each. This approach allows for standard distance cutoffs for short-range interactions and frequency cutoffs in Fourier space for long-range interactions.

## Models

- **Matformer**: An attention-based architecture with a graph construction that is invariant to unit cell translations and based on distance cutoffs.
- **Potnet**: Utilizes message passing on a graph to model atom interactions based on physical principles, capturing complete interatomic interactions.

## Experiments and Results

Our experiments show that implementing established techniques in a novel setting did not lead to expected improvements, with the exception of D4 Dispersion on Matformer, indicating a potential for overfitting.

## Discussion

Our findings highlight the challenges and considerations in applying machine learning to capture long-range interactions in crystal structures. The use of partial datasets can lead to efficient learning, but may also introduce overfitting and reduce generalization capabilities.
